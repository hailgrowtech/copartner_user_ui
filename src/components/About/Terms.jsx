                    its sole discretion, that you have breached any of the terms
                    and conditions of this Agreement. Following termination, you

                    access to the Platform is terminated, the Company reserves
                    the right to exercise whatever means it deems necessary to
                    prevent unauthorized access to the Platform. This Agreement
                    will survive indefinitely unless and until the Company
                    chooses, in its sole discretion and without advance to you,
                    to terminate it.
